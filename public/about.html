<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm an avid coder with a passion for web development and technology. Currently, <br> 
  I'm deepening my skills through a comprehensive web development course, building a diverse <br> 
  portfolio of over 32 websites. When I'm not coding, you can find me lifting weights at the <br> 
  gym, enjoying a peaceful day of fishing, or working on my truck. These hobbies keep me balanced and energized, <br> 
  allowing me to bring my best self to every project I undertake. Whether it's tackling a <br> 
  complex coding challenge or fixing up my truck, I love the satisfaction that comes from <br> 
  solving problems and creating something new.</p>
